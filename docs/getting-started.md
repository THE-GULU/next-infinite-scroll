# Getting Started with Next Infinite Scroll

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to install and start using Next Infinite Scroll in your React project.

## Installation

Install Next Infinite Scroll using yarn:

```bash
yarn add next-infinite-scroll
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm install next-infinite-scroll
```

## Implementing Infinite Scrolling

Once you've installed `NextInfiniteScroll`, you can import it and use it to implement infinite scrolling in your components. Here's an example:

Firstly, import the `InfiniteScroll` component:

```tsx
import React from "react"

import InfiniteScroll from "next-infinite-scroll"

// Import other necessary components or data fetching functions
// ...
```

# Using the Next-infinite-scroll in a Component

```tsx
import React from "react"
import InfiniteScroll from "next-infinite-scroll"

function App() {
  // Define your data fetching functions
  const loadMore = () => {
    // Logic to load more data goes here.
  }

  const refreshPage = () => {
    // Logic to refresh the page goes here.
  }

  return (
    <InfiniteScroll next={loadMore} pullDown={refreshPage}>
      {/* Infinite scroll content goes here */}
    </InfiniteScroll>
  )
}

export default App
```

In this example, `InfiniteScroll` component automatically loads more content as users scroll to the bottom of the page. It also allows users to refresh the page by pulling it down..

Now you can customize the `loadMore` and `refreshPage` functions to fetch data and update the UI accordingly.

This is a basic example, but `next-infinite-scroll` is flexible and powerful, allowing you to implement complex infinite scrolling behavior easily. Check out the other guides to learn more about the capabilities of Next Infinite `next-infinite-scroll`!
